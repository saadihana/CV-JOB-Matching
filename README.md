## Project Description

CV-JOB Matching System is an AI-powered platform that automatically matches candidate CVs to job descriptions using semantic similarity and natural language processing (NLP).

This system helps recruiters:
- Analyze the job description to extract key requirements (skills, education, experience, region).
- Parse and process multiple CVs (PDF/DOCX formats).
- Score and rank candidates based on section-wise similarity to the job offer.
- Customize matching criteria with weighted preferences.

Ideal for streamlining recruitment by providing automated, explainable, and flexible CV matching.

## Core Features

### Document Processing
- Supports multi-format CV parsing (PDF, DOCX, plain text).
- Extracts structured job requirements from free-text job descriptions.
- Displays extracted sections: Skills, Education, Experience, and Region.

### Matching Engine
- Uses sentence-transformers for semantic similarity computation.
- Assigns a score per section and calculates a total weighted score.
- Allows recruiters to adjust importance sliders for each section.
- Accepts/rejects candidates based on a configurable threshold.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React.js (with TypeScript)
- Next.js framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for result visualization

### Backend
- Python 3.10
- FastAPI for serving APIs
- spaCy for NLP pre-processing
- Sentence-Transformers (BERT-based models) for semantic matching

Note: A persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and Redis caching system are currently not required but are part of our future plans to enable user account management, history tracking, and analytics.
